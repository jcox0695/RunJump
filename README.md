## RunJump

Travel different worlds with Pedro and help him reach the flags!
Dodge the enemies but look out! Some enemies stay on platforms and some can fly! 
Pay attention to gravity on the different worlds because some will make you jump and float higher than others! 
Get all 4 flags and Pedro will become King of the Galaxy!

### Scoring

You start the game with 3 lives for the entire game.
You lose one life each time you get hit by an enemy.
You will have a brief invincibility period after you are hit by an enemy so get away!
Play with your friends and brag to them about how good you are and how you have a higher score!
At the end of the game, a message will be displayed either 'you win' or 'you lose'.
The ultimate goal is to complete all 4 levels so help Pedro stay safe and reach the flags!
